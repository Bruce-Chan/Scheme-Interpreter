# Scheme-Interpreter
Berkeley CS61A project 4. 

An interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language. 

Since I only include a subset of the language, my interpreter will not exactly match the behavior of other interpreters.

This project includes several files, but all of your changes will be made to the first four: scheme.py, scheme_reader.py, questions.scm, and tests.scm. You can download all of the project code as a zip archive, which contains the following files:

scheme.py: the Scheme evaluator
scheme_reader.py: the Scheme syntactic analyzer
questions.scm: a collection of functions written in Scheme
tests.scm: a collection of test cases written in Scheme
scheme_tokens.py: a tokenizer for Scheme
scheme_primitives.py: definitions for primitive Scheme procedures
buffer.py: a Buffer implementation, used in scheme_reader.py
ucb.py: utility functions for 61A
ok: the autograder
tests: a directory of tests used by ok
