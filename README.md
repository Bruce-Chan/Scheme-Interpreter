# Scheme-Interpreter
Berkeley CS61A project 4. 

An interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language. 

Since I only include a subset of the language, my interpreter will not exactly match the behavior of other interpreters.

scheme.py: the Scheme evaluator
scheme_reader.py: the Scheme syntactic analyzer
questions.scm: a collection of functions written in Scheme
tests.scm: a collection of test cases written in Scheme
scheme_tokens.py: a tokenizer for Scheme
scheme_primitives.py: definitions for primitive Scheme procedures
buffer.py: a Buffer implementation, used in scheme_reader.py
ucb.py: utility functions for 61A
ok: the autograder
tests: a directory of tests used by ok
